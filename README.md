# HELLO WORLD! from Bogota.

## About of me:writing_hand:

👋 Hello there! I'm a student of Systems Engineering at the Konrad Lorenz University Foundation. I have a strong passion for technology and a relentless drive to learn, often taking a self-taught approach to expand my knowledge.

💡 At the moment, I'm diving into the fascinating world of web technologies, exploring the intricacies of web development and design. I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

🌐 My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer, and I believe that continuous learning and staying curious are key to achieving that. I'm excited about the ever-evolving tech landscape and look forward to contributing to open-source projects and sharing my own work with the GitHub community.

🚀 Let's connect and learn together!
